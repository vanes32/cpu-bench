# CPU Benchmark for OpenWrt Devices
This script benchmarks CPU performance on OpenWrt devices using stress-ng.

It measures **Bogo Ops/s** for **int64** and **matrixprod** methods on both single-thread and multi-thread execution.

The results are printed as a Markdown-formatted table row, ready to be copied into the table below.  
Feel free to submit a pull request with benchmark results from your device.
